# PROBLEM 6:
#     The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,   
#         1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#
#     The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 
#         (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
#
#     Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the 
#     first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
#     3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#
#     Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
#     one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
#
# ANSWER: 
#     The square of sums is: 25502500
#     The sum of squares is: 338350
#     The difference of between the two is: 25164150
