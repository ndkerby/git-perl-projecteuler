# PROBLEM 21:
#     Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n 
#     (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
#
#     If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are 
#     an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable 
#     numbers.
#
#         For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 
#             1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; 
#         therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 
#             1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
#
#     Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
#
# ANSWER: 
#    The sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000: 31626
